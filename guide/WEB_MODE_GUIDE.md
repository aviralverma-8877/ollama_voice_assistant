# Web Mode Guide

The voice assistant now supports a **Web Mode** that allows you to interact with it through a beautiful web interface instead of the command line!

## 🌐 What is Web Mode?

Web Mode launches a local web server that hosts a browser-based interface for the voice assistant. Instead of using your terminal and microphone directly, you can:

- Open a webpage in your browser
- Click a button to record your voice
- See the transcribed text
- Read the assistant's response
- Listen to the audio response

This is perfect for:
- Users who prefer a visual interface
- Remote access scenarios
- Better conversation history viewing
- Multi-user access (everyone on the same network can use it)

## 🚀 How to Use Web Mode

### Step 1: Start the Assistant

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 2: Select Mode

When prompted, choose option **[2] Web Mode**:

```
🎙️  VOICE ASSISTANT - MODE SELECTION

How would you like to use the voice assistant?
  [1] CLI Mode  - Use microphone directly in terminal
  [2] Web Mode  - Launch web server with browser interface

Your choice [1/2]: 2
```

### Step 3: Configure Server (Optional)

You can use the default settings or customize:

```
Default settings:
  Host: 0.0.0.0 (accessible on local network)
  Port: 5000

Use custom settings?
  [1] Yes - Let me configure
  [2] No  - Use defaults
```

**Defaults work great for most users!** The server will be accessible from any device on your local network.

### Step 4: Open Your Browser

Once the server starts, you'll see:

```
🌐 VOICE ASSISTANT WEB SERVER

🔗 Access the web interface from:
   • Local:   http://localhost:5000
   • Network: http://192.168.1.100:5000

💡 Share the network URL with other devices on your local network

📋 Wake word: 'computer' (optional in web mode)
🤖 Using model: gemma3:4b

⚠  Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

**Access locally:** `http://localhost:5000`
**Access from network:** Use the network URL shown (your actual IP will be displayed)

### Step 5: Use the Web Interface

1. **Click the microphone button** 🎤 (it will turn red when recording)
2. **Speak your question** (no wake word needed!)
3. **Click again to stop** recording
4. Watch as:
   - Your speech is transcribed
   - The assistant generates a response
   - Audio response plays automatically

## 🔧 Configuration

### Change Default Port

If port 5000 is already in use, you can change it:

```python
# When prompted, select "Yes - Let me configure"
# Then enter your desired port (e.g., 8080, 3000, etc.)
```

### Network Access (Default)

By default, the server is accessible on your local network:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:5000`
- **Network:** `http://YOUR_IP:5000` (shown when server starts)

To restrict to localhost only:
```python
# When prompted, select "Yes - Let me configure"
# Then enter:
# Host: 127.0.0.1
# Port: 5000
```

### Change Model

When starting in web mode, you'll still be prompted to select an Ollama model if `PROMPT_MODEL_SELECTION = True` in `src/config.py`.

## 🆚 CLI Mode vs Web Mode

| Feature | CLI Mode | Web Mode |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Interface** | Terminal | Browser |
| **Wake Word** | Required ("computer") | Not needed |
| **Audio Input** | Direct microphone | Button-click recording |
| **Conversation History** | No visual history | Full visual history |
| **Audio Playback** | Automatic speaker | Audio player controls |
| **Multi-user** | Single user | Multiple users can access |
| **Remote Access** | Local only | Can be network-accessible |
| **Microphone Setup** | May need volume adjustments | Browser handles it |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see: `Address already in use`

**Solution:** Choose a different port when configuring, or stop the other program using port 5000.

### Microphone Not Working

**Solution:** Check browser permissions:
1. Click the lock icon in the address bar
2. Allow microphone access
3. Refresh the page

### "No speech detected"

**Solutions:**
1. Speak louder and closer to the microphone
2. Check browser microphone settings
3. Try a different browser (Chrome/Edge work best)
4. Ensure browser has microphone permissions

### Server Won't Start

**Solution:** Make sure Flask is installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Can't Access from Another Device

**Solutions:**
1. The default settings should work (host: 0.0.0.0)
2. Check your firewall settings - allow port 5000
3. Ensure both devices are on the same network (same WiFi)
4. Use the network URL shown when server starts
5. Make sure you're using your computer's IP, not localhost or 127.0.0.1

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Local Network Access**: By default, the server is accessible to all devices on your local network (0.0.0.0)
- **No Authentication**: Web mode doesn't have password protection
- **Don't Expose to Internet**: This is meant for local/trusted network use only
- **Conversation History**: Stored in memory only, cleared when server restarts
- **Trust Your Network**: Only use on networks you trust, as anyone on the network can access the assistant

## 💡 Tips

1. **No Wake Word Needed**: Unlike CLI mode, you don't need to say "computer" first - just click and speak!

2. **Better for Testing**: Web mode is great when testing speech recognition since you can see exactly what was transcribed.

3. **Multiple Conversations**: Open multiple browser tabs to see different conversation threads.

4. **Mobile Access**: If you set `host: 0.0.0.0`, you can access from your phone browser on the same WiFi network.

5. **Clear History**: Click "Clear History" to start a fresh conversation without restarting the server.

## 📱 Mobile Usage

Yes, you can use it on your phone!

1. Start the server (default settings work!)
2. Check the network URL displayed when server starts
3. Open your phone's browser (connect to same WiFi)
4. Go to the network URL shown (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:5000`)
5. Tap the microphone to speak

**Tip:** The server automatically displays your network IP when it starts!

## 🎯 When to Use Each Mode

**Use CLI Mode when:**
- You prefer keyboard and terminal interfaces
- You want hands-free operation with wake words
- You're comfortable with command-line tools
- You want the assistant always listening

**Use Web Mode when:**
- You prefer visual interfaces
- You want to see conversation history
- You're testing or debugging speech recognition
- You want to access from multiple devices
- You prefer button-click recording over always-listening

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! You're ready to use the voice assistant in web mode. Enjoy! 🎉
